how to and what  to contribute, as a beginner
7/30/2019

After spending some time browsing github for projects (anything really) that were seemingly at my level, I gave up and moved onto the MDN as I remembered they had options for people who were just interested in helping with words rather than code. I'm still at the 'getting started' stage, reading all about the formatting needed for summarizing pages. Definitely more my speed and I'm learning things. Hoping by the end of the week I'll have made my first contribution that won't need a major overhaul. Fingers crossed.
